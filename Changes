0.80  - Wed Sep 26 21:00:00 2001
        Big version jump - lots of changes
        Removed Prepare method - now call new() with the filename\string reference
        Updated newSerial() to give date based serial numbers by default
        Fixed missing bracket in SOA of PrintZone() (Thanks to Brian Pellin)
        Added more warning messages
        More OO approach - try and hide the internals because they will probably change
        Added Autoloaded accessors a(), cname(), mx(), ns(), ptr(), soa() etc.
        Added a Dump() method to return a Hash of the records (better than using internals directly)
        Updated documentation and examples
        Added standard perl license
        make 'dist' - hope this improves CPAN listing.
	 	Added more serious tests for the CPAN-testers
